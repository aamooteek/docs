_Thank you so much_ for your interest in one of the powerful and flexible WordPress access management plugins, the Advanced Access Manager (aka AAM).

This reference contains the complete feature list in the free AAM 6.0.0+ that you can interact with through UI. Some sections have links to articles that explain the related feature in greater detail.

We prepared this reference for everybody who wants to learn AAM UI functionality. However, AAM comes with a more advanced set of tools like Access Policies or programmatic APIs for developers, and these topics are not included in this reference.

::: info FYI!
If you do not know where to start exploring AAM functionality or how to use it to manage access to your website, you may consider checking the [Get Started](/get-started) page.
