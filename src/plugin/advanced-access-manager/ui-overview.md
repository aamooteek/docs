AAM is quite a complex plugin with a few hundred different features. We spent most of our dev work on an intuitive and easy-to-use UI to maximize the webmasterâ€™s efficiency. Check this introductory video that walks you through AAM UI.

## Why UI?

We built AAM UI to give you an easy way to manage the most common access controls to WordPress resources for any role, individual user, and visitors (anonymous users) or define default access settings altogether.

For an untrained user, the UI may appear overwhelming. However, with a bit of mental effort, you can grasp the main idea quickly. So, let's dive in.

## How is UI organized?

When you are on the _AAM_ page, you always manage access controls for somebody. It can be a role, user, or default access for everybody (including your user). Pay attention to the _Status Bar_ at the top of the page that tells you for what role or user you manage access.

::: danger Important!
AAM allows managing access for the high privilege roles and users like _Administrator_ or your user. Pay extra attention to the _Status Bar_ to avoid accidentally restricting access to critical pages or the entire website. If you made the mistake, do not panic, you can always [reset AAM settings](/question/aam/how-to-reset-aam-settings).
:::

The UI is divided into two areas.
- The _Access Controls_ area includes the collection of various tabs like "Backend Menu", "Posts & Terms" or "404 Redirect". This is the place where you can configure your desired access controls and behavior.
- The _Sidebar_ area contains a couple of widgets that allow you to switch between different AAM pages like "Settings", and "Add-Ons" or select to which role or user you want to manage access controls.
