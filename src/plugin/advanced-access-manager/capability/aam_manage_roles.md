::: info Note!
The [aam_manager](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/capability/aam_manager) should be also granted.
:::

The custom capability `aam_manage_roles` grants the ability for a user to see the list of roles on the AAM UI page or through the [RESTful API endpoint](/advanced/restful/role). This is the first capability that you need to grant to a user if you want them to be able to do any other activities with roles like creating new or deleting existing ones.
