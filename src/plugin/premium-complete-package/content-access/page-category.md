title: Group pages into categories
---

Similarly to the [Media Category](/plugin/premium-complete-package/content-access/media-category), the [Complete Package] registers the custom taxonomy "Page Categories" that allows grouping pages into categories. This way, you can easily define access controls to a group of pages.

For details, refer to the [Page Category](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/setting/page-category) page.
