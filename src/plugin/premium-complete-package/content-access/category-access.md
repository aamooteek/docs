title: Manage access to hierarchical taxonomies
---

First, let's define what _hierarchical taxonomy_ means because there are many definitions online, and all of them are correct in one way or another.

We try to keep everything simple and straight to the point, so in our mind, the _hierarchical taxonomy_ is a type of taxonomy that allows the creation of a hierarchy of terms where each child term can have **only one** parent. The perfect example of a hierarchical taxonomy is the "Post Categories".

::: info FYI!
The technical definition of the "Post Category" or "Category" is - _the term of the `category` taxonomy_.
:::

Typically we (WordPress users) create _terms_ to group one or more _posts_. In other words, we organize our _posts_ by grouping them with taxonomies. So it is natural to want to have the ability to manage access to these groups and expect that all belonging _posts_ inherit these controls. It is where the premium Complete Package brings power.

You can manage access to both custom and WordPress core hierarchical taxonomies on the AAM page with the [Posts & Terms](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/service/post-term) service or directly on the _Edit Term_ page (if the [Render Access Manager Metabox](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/setting/render-access-metabox) is enabled).

Another way to manage access controls to terms is through the [access policies](/advanced/access-policy/) and the premium add-on extends its functionality with [additional resources](/plugin/premium-complete-package/content-access/access-policy-resources).
