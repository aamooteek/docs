<p>How does the AAM pricing model works? Can you please clarify how much do I pay and when?</p>
</div>
<p>The premium &quot;Complete Package&quot; adopts unorthodox pricing model. First of all, this is a yearly subscription plan. However, you pay only once the full amount during initial purchase, and all subsequent years a much smaller amount to be able to download new updates. For example, if you pay $99 USD today, then next year, the renewal amount will be only $49 USD.</p>
<p>Another differentiating factor is that you pay as you go. By default, you can install the premium plugin on up to 3 different domains. In other words, you purchase a license key that you can use to download the premium plugin and install it on up to 3 different websites.</p>
<p>However, if you need to extend this limit, then move forward and install the downloaded plugin on as many websites as needed. Our system will automatically detect new domain and schedule a one time charge of $19.99 USD per each new domain. We will adjust the renewal amount as well and add additional $9.99 USD.  For example, if you install the premium plugin on five websites in one year, we will charge additional $39.98 USD for extra two websites, and the renewal amount will be $68.98 USD.</p>
<p>The renewal cost is adjusted both ways. With the same notion, if you reduce the number of active domains, the yearly amount will reduce accordingly. However, the minimum amount remains at $49 USD.</p>
<div class="custom-container tip">
<p class="custom-container-title">Note!</p>
<p>If you accidentally install the premium plugin on a new website, or you  need to run some tests first, you have up to seven days to uninstall the plugin and  deactivate the domain on the <a href="/license">license page</a>. This way, we will not charge you for the extra domain.</p>
</div>
<p>If you know up-front that you will be using the premium plugin on more than three websites, then you can increase the number of domains during the checkout process with <strong>Additional Domains</strong> field.</p>
