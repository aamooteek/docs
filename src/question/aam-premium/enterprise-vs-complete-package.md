title: What is the difference between Enterprise & Complete Package?
---

::: question Question
We are evaluating the Enterprise Package option. However, we are not sure if that is the right choice for us. What is the difference between Enterprise and a regular Complete Package?
:::

From the technical point of view, there is no difference between Enterprise and Complete pages. Both **are the same codebase** and incorporate the same set of features.

**Do not consider** buying the Enterprise package solely because you need to install our premium plugin on a dozen websites. Just based on simple math, you will substantially overpay. Instead, choose the Complete Package option and "pay-as-you-go" the one-time fee of $19.99 for each new website when you exceed your license limit.

Note! If you have a WordPress multisite, you do not need more than one license for the entire network as long as the multisite is a single WordPress instance. Check [How does licensing work with WP multisite?](/question/licensing/multisite) Q&A for more info.

However, if you are a busy agency, a large enterprise, or an individual who needs dedicated engineering support, this is where the Enterprise Package makes the difference. For such customers, we reserve monthly Zoom calls. We can discuss in-depth your unique project initiatives and even help to write code. Since 2011 we acquired some hardcore experience with WordPress, even 30 minutes of our time saves dozens of hours for our clients. In some instances, our advice saved thousands of dollars.
