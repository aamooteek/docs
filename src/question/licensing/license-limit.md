title: How does the license limit work?
---

::: question Question
On my license page, I see the _up to 3 domains before additional charges may apply_ statement. What is the license limit, and how does it work?
:::

The license limit is the number of domains you can have the premium [Complete Package](/premium) installed before purchasing additional credits for a one-time fee of $19.99.

::: info Note!
The license limit **does not** contribute to the final cost of the yearly renewal. The renewal cost is calculated based on the license type and the number of active domains.

Let's say, Emily purchased a Regular license key for $79. It allows her to download and use the Complete Package on up to 3 domains. She activated the premium add-on on three websites successfully. At this point, her year subscription amount stays at $49.

Her project expands, and she needs the premium add-on on one more website. So she downloads and installs the Complete Package on the fourth domain. Because Emily's license limit is up to 3 domains, our system notifies her via email about the upcoming one-time charge of $19.99 for the additional domain, and her subscription amount goes up by $9.99.

It all may sound unconventional. However, if you do the math, you notice that after obtaining a license key, you can purchase additional copies of the premium Complete Package only for $19.99. And then you pay only $9.99/per year to keep that copy up-to-date with new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.
