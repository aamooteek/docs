::: question Question
We are considering installing AAM on our site, and will be using granular access to pages, taxonomies, etc, so we plan to purchase the Complete Package. However, our site is a multisite on a single domain. There are several sub-sites in that domain for different departments (`example.com/admissions`, `example.com/library`, etc). We're hoping we don't need to buy the enterprise edition. Will Complete Package make AAM work across all our sub-sites in our domain?
