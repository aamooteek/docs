::: question Question
Do I have to buy a new license key if I want to install the premium Complete Package on more than three domains?
:::

The short answer is **no**. Your license limit is elastic and it can stretch indefinitely. We adopted the "pay-as-you-go" model where if you have an active subscription, we automatically draft payments from your account when our system detects new domains. The process is fully transparent and we send all the necessary email communications so you are aware of any upcoming charges.

You can learn more about our pricing model from the [How does the pricing work?](/question/licensing/pricing-model) Q&A.
