::: question Question
I can't afford to pay $69 for the premium software because it either takes a big cut from my income or I need only one specific feature. Can you please give me a discount?

We recognize that the cost of goods and living varies between countries around the globe. A WordPress software engineer in the USA may not get out of their bed for less than $50/hour. However, for an engineer in Pakistan or CÃ´te d'Ivoire, this may be a monthly income.

We also acknowledge that the [Premium Complete Package](/plugin/premium-complete-package/) has many features you may not need.

We want to help everybody to archive their ambitious WordPress plans. If the premium price trumps it, we can accommodate you and provide a discount or even give you a complimentary license.

Please submit the contact form below and let us know things like:

- Where are you located?
- What do you do?
- How AAM helps you to solve your project requirements?
- How much are you willing to pay for our premium?

Don't be shy to provide as much detail as you wish. The more we know you, the more we are keen to help you.
