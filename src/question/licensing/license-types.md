title: Which license type is right for me?

::: question Question
I'm not sure which license type should I choose that best suits my budget and needs. Can you please explain the difference?
:::

Currently, we offer four different license types. However, essentially they all allow you to download the same add-on. The differentiating factor comes with the initial license limit and level of customer support.

Here is a quick comparison table for all four types.

| &nbsp; | Starter | Regular | Trial | Enterprise |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- |
| One time fee | $69 | $79 | $79 | $999 |
| Recurring fee | $49 | $49 | $49 | $999 |
| Expires in (unless successfully auto-renewed) | 1 year | 1 year | 14 days | 1 year |
| Limit (websites) | 1 | 3 | 3 | 100 |
| Monthly dedicated tech support | No | No | No | Yes |

These are just a few questions that may help you to choose the right license type.

- **Do you need the premium add-on installed on only one website?** If so, then you might consider the `Starter` license type. However, please make sure that you **do not** have the premium add-on installed on more than one active domain. Otherwise, we may suspend your license key.

- **Do you need to have the premium add-on installed on more than one website?** If that is the case, then go with the `Regular` license because it gives you three limits. The typical use case for the `Regular` license is when you have staging and production sites.

- **You are not sure if the premium add-on is what you need.** Go with the `Trial` license. We require you to enter payment details. However, we will not charge until the trial period ends in 14 days. After the trial period ends, the we automatically convert a license to the `Regular` license type.

- **Do you have a large number of websites (50+)?** In this case, consider the `Enterprise` license type. We also offer dedicated engineering time with you regularly to answer difficult questions or guide you through tricky implementations. You can find more detail about the Enterprise license in the [What is the difference between Enterprise & Complete Package?](/question/aam-premium/enterprise-vs-complete-package).

::: info Note!
Disregarding which license type you choose, the license limit is still elastic. In other words, you can install the premium add-on on as many websites as you need. For more detail, check the [Do I have to buy a new license if I exceed the limit?](/question/licensing/exceeded-license-limit)
