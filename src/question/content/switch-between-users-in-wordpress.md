title: Switch between users in WordPress
order: 2
---

There are a few decent and free WordPress plugins that allow you to switch between different users without login out from the backend. For example, the “User Switching” plugin is a very good option, however, it comes with slight inconvenience. Each time you switch to a different user, you lose your administrator’s session. So you need to switch back to your original user if any additional changes need to be done to your desired user.

## Something

It is very common, especially when you are trying to determine correct access controls, to switch back-n-force between administrator session and desired user, until all the necessary access settings are configured correctly. This can turn into an irritating and time-consuming process if you keep switching multiple times.

## Something else

AAM has the solution for you and it is quite a simple one, however, requires you to run either two separate browsers or use incognito mode for the second session. Further, I’m going to show how I can be logged in as an administrator in one window and in the second incognito window as the desired user.
