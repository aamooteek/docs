title: How to override access controls for Administrators?
---

::: question Question
Occasionally, I set default access controls to specific posts and pages independently on the "Posts & Terms" tab. Sometimes I forget to override these settings for the _Administrator_ role, and my posts disappear. Is there a way to exclude administrators, so I do not have to override each post or page?

The short and unfortunate answer is **no**. However, there are ways around it if you have the premium [Complete Package](/premium), so proceed with the reading.

Technically speaking, the _Administrator_ role is not any different than the _Subscriber_ role. They only vary by the assigned list of capabilities and intuitive understanding of what administrators can do and what subscribers. Honestly, you can have a fully functioning website without the _Administrator_ role. So, AAM does not differentiate the _Administrator_ from other roles.

When you have an ever-growing list of posts and pages with customized access controls, it is wise to group them by category, tag, or custom taxonomy (let's call all of them collective as _term_). This way, you can define default access controls for that _term_ and override it only once for the _Administrator_ role.

Then, whenever you need to customize access controls for any post or page, you assign it to that _term_. The access controls will be automatically propagated.
