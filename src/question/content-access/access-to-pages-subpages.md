title: How to manage access to pages and their sub-pages?
---

::: question Question
I have several pages with sub-pages. Some pages may have several nested levels of sub-pages. Can all my sub-pages inherit access settings from their parent pages?

The short answer is **yes**. However, this feature requires the premium [Complete Package add-on](/premium).

You can find more detail on the [Manage access to pages and their sub-pages](/plugin/premium-complete-package/content-access/manage-access-to-pages-and-subpages) page.
