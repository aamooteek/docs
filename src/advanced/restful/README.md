title: AAM RESTful API
---

The free [Advanced Access Manager](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/) plugin extends the WordPress RESTful API with a new namespace  -`/aam/v2`, and a bunch of handy endpoints the access management needs.

All endpoints follow the WordPress RESTful API best practices and promote standardization and consistency. They are secure, reliable, and customizable to suit your unique website requirements.
